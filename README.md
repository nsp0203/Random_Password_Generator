# Random_Password_Generator

This project aims to develop a software application that
generates strong and secure passwords for users. This
application generates strong passwords that meet the
criteria for robust security. This includes a combination of
uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special
characters, and a configurable length. I had used HTML,
CSS and JavaScript technologies in this project. HTML is
used for structuring the website's content, while CSS is
used for styling purpose. While JavaScript is used for
implementing the core logic of generating random
passwords based on the specified requirements.
